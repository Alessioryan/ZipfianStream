I saw someone and I was like huh she would really know how to make velar fricatives. 
Got me thinking...

What if we each had an inventory that was the basis for a made up langauge that represents us? Her inventory would have velar fricatives high up there, especially unvoiced velar fricatives.

The goal: given an inventory, an optional ordering of frequency, and a basic syllable structure, generate a stream of IPA text that would be used in the made up language the person speaks.
